## Functionality

1. Display an organisational chart for a list of employees and the supervisor.
2. The node in the tree can be draged and droped to another node(to be the child node if the target item). 
3. The node can't be moved to it's own child nodes.
4. When an item triggers the onDragStart, it will show the potentional allowed drop positions by dashed boder.
